# RaiderRobotics16762 - *Repository for Seneca Valley School District's main FIRST Tech Challenge team (Team #16762)*

## Who are we?
Hi! Our FTC -- *FIRST Tech Challenge* -- team is home-grown in the Seneca Valley Senior High School, where we hold an in-school class specifically for our efforts.
We currently have two teams -- *Raider Robotics 16762 and Raider Robotics Reloaded 25654* -- that work and assist each other in the same room with the same teacher. Subsequently, our participants are ranged from Freshman to Seniors that intermingle and help each other along the way.

## What's in this repo?
Currently, this repo will hold our **ENTIRE** robot code from top to bottom. This includes our manual, autonomous, testing, and debugging programs alongside other libraries we have installed.
***NOTE: We do only use Java as our programming language!!***

## What external softwares/libraries does your team use?
As of 2025, our team has branched out into using *[RoadRunner](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart)* and *[MeepMeep](https://github.com/rh-robotics/MeepMeep)* for our autonomous pathing. Otherwise, we make it all ourselves!

## What have you put on your bot?
For the ***Into The Deep*** season, we are currently using:
  - 4 Mecanum Wheels
  - 6 DcMotors (4 for driving and 2 for our 4-stage viper lift)
  - 2 Servos (1 Axon Servo for our arm/elbow and 1 GoBilda Servo for our claw mechanism)
  - 2 GoBilda Odometry/Dead Wheels

In terms of our strategy for this season, we opted for a claw piece that slots into each sample side and clamps them down. In doing so, we have mostly focused on basket-dropping since it is our most efficient, but we are still able to utilize specimens. As well, we chose to 3D model our claw piece so that it does in fact fit perfectly in each sample.

## Do you have any resources for help?
From our experience, I would greatly suggest taking a peek at the *[Java Documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.firstinspires.ftc)* and the *[FTC Documentation](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/index.html)* that goes into detail about how to set up your robot and find any methods or classes you may need. As well, we will eventually make videos that detail every process and step we took in our design process, the release of which is TBD!
